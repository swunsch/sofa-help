Hello alltogether,

I try to model a rotating structure (3D FEM "beam"). At one end its surface should be connected rigidly to a "Reference Particle" which is given a rotational boundary condition.

Using stuff from this post.
https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/forum/topic/rotating-an-object-with-a-angular-velocity-and-conserving-collisions/

I build my scene

see file: beam_rot_06_rigi_map_part_contrl_q_1_1.scn


Problem 1: The Rigid mapping maps the to the whole beam, not just the particles from BoxROI but using

<RigidMapping input="@.." output="@." />

I think @. uses of the whole MechanicalObject beam so all the mechanicalDOFs of the beam. Okay.

What I need is the Mapping to only some of the DOFs of the MechanicalObject beam. I can select the particles needed with 

<BoxROI name="slaveParticles" box="0 -16 -11  0 16 11" drawBoxes="true"/>

but in the 
file: beam_rot_06_rigi_map_part_contrl_q_1_2.scn
I cannot map to those points/particles/DOFs from BoxROI selection

both
<RigidMapping input="@.." output="@slaveParticles" />
or 
<RigidMapping input="@.." output="@slaveParticles.indices" />

are not working.

How is it possible to connect (rigid connection) only some points/particles/DOFs to the Rigid3d?
