Good morning everyone, 
my name is Simon and I am new to SOFA.
First of all <strong>BIG THANK YOU</strong> to all the people behind SOFA making this great open-source software possible.

<strong>Background</strong>: I am an MS/M.Sc. in mechanical engineering and working in industrial projects using Multi-body-simulations and Finite-Elements software. Apart from my regular job I try to build up knowledge in open-source software for typical engineering problems. Starting from Salome/Code-Aster and going towards Calculix for FEA I am seeking for an multi-body/dynamics open-source software solution. Stumbling upon MBDyn, Project::CHRONO, SOFA & NiftySim a few years ago I want to discover SOFA a little more focused now.

<strong>Intentions</strong>: Basically I want do understand and explore SOFA's capabilites in dynamical simulaion of mechancial systems focusing on mechanical engineering problems. 	
 
<strong>"Roadmap"</strong>: 
- while (knowledge < sufficent knowledge) 
  {
		https://www.sofa-framework.org/documentation
<em>		examples/</em>
		try2understand(https://www.sofa-framework.org/api/master/sofa/html/index.html)
  }
- <strong>Creating/rebuilding example problems by:</strong> 
	- building SOFA simulations
	- building simulations of the same problem in different software (e.g. ABAQUS, Calculix, ..?..)
	- using analytical (if possible) or other reference solutions as reference
	- comparing both simulations in terms of: 
			- ability to model the problem (comparison to reference)
			- computation time/used computational resources
			
- Making my work/progress available to the open-source community by:
	- <a href="https://github.com/swunsch/sofa-help">https://github.com/swunsch/sofa-help</a> (which is my first GitHub "project")
		- also use github as my content-storage to collect and link stuff

<strong>Question:</strong>
I want to prepare my future forum post in an external editor. But what is the "language/syntax" of a post? For e.g. <strong><blockquote></strong>


Thank you and have a nice day
Simon

P.S.
some test for future forum posts (because I am new to forum posts(in general) as well)
